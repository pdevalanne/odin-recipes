    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine rice and water in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat, cover, and simmer for 20 minutes, or until water is absorbed. Stir in milk, cover, and cook until milk is absorbed by the rice, about 20 minutes. Season with salt to taste.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (220 degrees C).</li>
        <li>In a medium bowl, stir together salt and rye flour. Stir in water. Mix in all-purpose flour 1 tablespoon at a time until dough is just past the sticky stage. Divide the dough into 16 equal portions.</li>
        <li>On a lightly floured surface, roll each piece of dough out into a thin circle, 6 inches in diameter. The dough should be as thin as possible. Place about 3 tablespoons of the rice mixture in the center of each circle. Spread the mixture out to within 1 inch of the edges. Fold the edges of the dough upward, and crimp the edges so as to allow the pastries to hold their shape. Pinch the sides at each end to form a little boat. Place pastries about 3 inches apart on an ungreased baking sheet, and brush the tops with butter.</li>
        <li>Bake for 10 to 15 minutes in the preheated oven, until the dough is firm, and the rice porridge is slightly browned on the top.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Serve warm on a plate or board.  Serves 1 - or 1,000 if you can swing a miracle.</p>
